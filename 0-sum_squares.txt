An algorithm that calculates the sum of squares of given input of numbers:

Declare the total number of numbers that would be summed; total _num = n
Declare the variable to accept inputs; x = Input
Declare the variable to calculate the sum; sum = 0
Do a loop so                                WHILE x < n:
the computer keeps calculating the square	        square = x * x
calculate the sum until the values are exhausted    sum =sum + square 
print out the total_sum; output sum
